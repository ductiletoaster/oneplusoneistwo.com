## TODOs
- Optimize for smaller screens
- Not sure about the bees might do a variant with just some of the gray scale flowers
- Add bees and some of the border icons placing text in the center 
- Try both white and off white backgrounds (can make it toggable?) 
- login screen with a single underlined field, text says you  are invited and some black/gray icons (vectors) -- animation into next screen...
- maybe even a day and night theme??? sleepy bees and stuff
